# Multi-classClassification_CNN


## Overview
It is multi-class classification project. I will be using the (https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

## Project Description
This CNN project is centered around multi-class classification. The objective is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can accurately classify images of sign language gestures into their respective letters of the English alphabet. The dataset utilized for this task is the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Project Goals
- Implement data preprocessing techniques to prepare the images for input to a CNN.
- Train a convolutional neural network to classify each image as the letter it represents.
- Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, and potentially other metrics.
- Provide insights into the results and the process followed.
