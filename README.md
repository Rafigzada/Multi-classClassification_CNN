# Predicting the Next Word

I have created a model that predicts the next word in a text sequence. The model will be trained using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets. In addition to the model, you will also be building some helper functions to pre-process the data.

## Project Description
This NLP project focuses on the task of predicting the next word in a given text sequence. The specific corpus used for training is Shakespeare's sonnets. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and deep learning, you'll develop a model capable of generating contextually relevant next-word predictions. 

## Project Goals
- Implement data pre-processing techniques to prepare the Shakespearean sonnets for training.
- Build a neural network model for next-word prediction.
- Train the model on the sonnet dataset to learn language patterns.
- Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune as necessary.
- Create and share helper functions and utilities to facilitate data pre-processing and model deployment.

Let's get started!
